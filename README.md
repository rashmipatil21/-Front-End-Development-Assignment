The HTML structure is the foundation of the login page. It includes the essential elements like:
Username/Email field: An input field for the user to enter their email or username.
Password field: A password input where users enter their password.
Submit button: A button to submit the form and trigger the login process.
This creates the basic structure for the login form, linking to external CSS for styling and external JavaScript for functionality.

CSS STRUCTURE : 
CSS is used to style the login form to make it visually appealing and responsive. This includes padding, borders, colors, and media queries for responsiveness.
Key Features:
Body Styling: The body is centered with Flexbox and has a soft background.
Form Styling: The login form has padding, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow for a modern look.
Responsive Design: Media queries adjust the form layout and font size based on screen width (like for mobile devices).
Using media queries in the CSS ensures the login form adjusts its layout, font size, and padding for different screen sizes, especially for mobile users.

JAVASCRIPT STRUCTURE :
This ensures that the login page looks good on both large and small screenThe JavaScript file (script.js) provides the dynamic functionality of the login form, such as validating user input, handling the form submission, and showing or hiding the password.
Validation: Ensures that the email entered is valid and the password meets the required length.
API Integration: Sends a login request to an API and handles the response (either success or failure).
Show/Hide Password: Toggles between showing or hiding the password based on user inputs.
This ensures that the form validates input and interacts with the backend.

API Integration
The fetch API is used to send a POST request to the API endpoint with the username and password provided by the user. The server response is then handled, displaying appropriate messages like "Login successful" or "Login failed".
